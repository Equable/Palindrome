<h2><u><b>Contained are the Following</b></u></h2>



<h3><i><b>Palindrome.cpp</i></b></h3>


>WIP, so far checks the reverse of the string to see if it is equal to itself. Next to do the index check


<h2><b><u>Summary</u></b></h2>


>1. Prompt user for how many strings they plan to input to check if it is a palindrome. Cannot exceed 20 nor be lower than 1. Prompts for input again until this is met
>2. Start with the last string to check and push into a stack for later processing.
>3. Runs a check on each to see if it is or is not a palindrome. (Most likely will store these into a String array using some sort of counter as the index)
>4. WIP from this point onward: Most likely will calculate current string's length and half it (+1 to account for odd amounts)
>5. Test, if not met remove letter from right first, check if not then remove letter from left, check. Until No string present then print not a palindrome if not or palindrome and what to remove it it is.


<h2><b><u>Version</u></b></h2>

>   * To Be Added:
